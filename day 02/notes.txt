- Everything you can place inside a variable is an Object, 
    and every object is an instance of a class.

- Even numbers and functions are objects. 
    All objects inherit from the Object class.

- Specifying static types is optional but is preferetial as it clarifies
    your intent and enables static checking by dev tools.

- Dart supports top-level functions, like main(), as well as functions tied
    to a class or object (static and instance methods, respectively)

- Similarly, Dart supports top-level variables, as well as variables tied to
    a class or object (static and instance variables).

    Instance variables are sometimes known as fields or properties.

- Sometimes it matters whether something is an expression or a statement.

- Production mode ignores assert statements and static types.

- Uninitialized variables are always null to begin with.

- A final variable can be set only once.

- A const variable is a compile-time constatnt.
